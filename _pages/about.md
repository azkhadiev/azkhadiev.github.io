I’m a beamline scientist at the [P23 In Situ X-ray Diffraction and Imaging beamline](https://photon-science.desy.de/facilities/petra_iii/beamlines/p23_in_situ_x_ray_diffraction_and_imaging/index_eng.html) at [DESY](https://desy.de/), Hamburg. I apply advanced X-ray methods to explore the structure and chemical state of materials, particularly using sub-micron beams and anomalous diffraction to detect subtle and often hidden effects.

What fascinates me most is when a pattern in the data reveals something unexpected: a phase transition, a new correlation, or an underlying order that had previously gone unnoticed. I enjoy designing experiments that allow us to observe materials as they evolve, not as static structures, but as dynamic systems in motion. I like the way X-rays can make the invisible visible.

I also take great satisfaction in supporting users throughout their experiments. Seeing their excitement when something finally works feels like a shared discovery. It’s one of the most rewarding aspects of my work.
